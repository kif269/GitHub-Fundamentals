1) What I learned from this was how to make repositories and manage the GitHub space. I was able to learn how to clone these folders to Positron and figure out how to access certain projects.
2) Something I am still unsure about is the general "rules" and settings to GitHub. I am unsure specifically on the different betweens files and full repositories.
3) After experimenting with headers, I have figured out certain tools such as:
#hashtags can be used to denote various headings
##like second headings
###or third-level headings
you can also **bold** text and *italicize* text with <sub>subscripts</sub> as well
